#Why I made this list
1. Because bookmarks are a nightmare, even with Xmarks.
2. Because I give up on bookmarks and end up with an infinitely growing number of tabs every week or so, in fear that I foget about the amazing new resource I found.

So from now on I will keep only the best, most useful learning resources in this curated list.
